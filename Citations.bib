	abstract = {We have improved our evolutionary population synthesis models by including the latest set of stellar evolutionary tracks available, computed for five values of metal abundance in the range Z = 2Zsun\_ to Z = Zsun\_/20. We investigate here the effect of metallicity on the formation and evolution of massive stars, and its influence on a number of observable parameters. The population of Wolf-Rayet and red supergiant stars are the most affected by the metal abundance of the initial gas. {WR} stars can be dominant in the cluster at high metallicities, but are very scarce in underabundant scenarios, where mainly {WN}-type stars and almost no {WC} ones are formed. The population of red supergiants follows the same trend, decreasing their relative fraction an order of magnitude in underabundant regions. As a consequence, the V-K values predicted at low metallicities are significantly bluer than for near-solar metallicity clusters. The slower evolution of massive stars at low metallicities originates a trend towards hotter clusters and larger Hβ equivalent widths the lower the abundance. We have finally calibrated the intensity of the oxygen emission lines as a function of effective temperature, metallicity and number of ionizing stars. We have estimated in this way the effective temperature of a sample of emission lines galaxies, finding a trend towards hotter clusters the lower the metallicity, in accord with the model predictions.},

	abstract = {The Baldwin, Philips, \&amp; Terlevich diagram of [O {III}]/H\$β\$ vs. [N {II}]/H\$α\$ (hereafter N2-{BPT}) has long been used as a tool for classifying galaxies based on the dominant source of ionizing radiation. Recent observations have demonstrated that galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}sim2\$ reside offset from local galaxies in the N2-{BPT} space. In this paper, we conduct a series of controlled numerical experiments to understand the potential physical processes driving this offset. We model nebular line emission in a large sample of galaxies, taken from the {SIMBA} cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation, using the {CLOUDY} photoionization code to compute the nebular line luminosities from H {II} regions. We find that the observed shift toward higher [O {III}]/H\$β\$ and [N {II}]/H\$α\$ values at high redshift arises from sample selection: when we consider only the most massive galaxies \$M\_* {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10-11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, the offset naturally appears, due to their high metallicities. We predict that deeper observations that probe lower-mass galaxies will reveal galaxies that lie on a locus comparable to \$z{\textbackslash}sim 0\$ observations. Even when accounting for sample selection effects, we find that there is a subtle mismatch between simulations and observations. To resolve this discrepancy, we investigate the impact of varying ionization parameters, H {II} region densities, gas-phase abundance patterns, and increasing radiation field hardness on N2-{BPT} diagrams. We find that either decreasing the ionization parameter or increasing the N/O ratio of galaxies at fixed O/H can move galaxies along a self-similar arc in N2-{BPT} space that is occupied by high-redshift galaxies.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic diagrams of emission-line ratios have been used extensively to categorize extragalactic emission regions; however, these diagnostics are occasionally at odds with each other due to differing definitions. In this work, we study the applicability of supervised machine-learning techniques to systematically classify emission-line regions from the ratios of certain emission lines. Using the Million Mexican Model database, which contains information from grids of photoionization models using {\textbackslash}texttt\{cloudy\}, and from shock models, we develop training and test sets of emission line fluxes for three key diagnostic ratios. The sets are created for three classifications: classic {\textbackslash}hii\{\} regions, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants. We train a neural network to classify a region as one of the three classes defined above given three key line ratios that are present both in the {SITELLE} and {MUSE} instruments' band-passes: [\{{\textbackslash}sc O{\textbackslash},iii\}]\${\textbackslash}lambda5007\$/H\$β\$, [\{{\textbackslash}sc N{\textbackslash},ii\}]\${\textbackslash}lambda6583\$/H\$α\$, ([\{{\textbackslash}sc S{\textbackslash},ii\}]\${\textbackslash}lambda6717\$+[\{{\textbackslash}sc S{\textbackslash},ii\}]\${\textbackslash}lambda6731\$)/H\$α\$. We also tested the impact of the addition of the [\{{\textbackslash}sc O{\textbackslash},ii\}]\${\textbackslash}lambda3726,3729\$/[\{{\textbackslash}sc O{\textbackslash},iii\}]\${\textbackslash}lambda5007\$ line ratio when available for the classification. A maximum luminosity limit is introduced to improve the classification of the planetary nebulae. Furthermore, the network is applied to {SITELLE} observations of a prominent field of M33. We discuss where the network succeeds and why it fails in certain cases. Our results provide a framework for the use of machine learning as a tool for the classification of extragalactic emission regions. Further work is needed to build more comprehensive training sets and adapt the method to additional observational constraints.},

We highlight some of the key observational insights that influenced our current understanding of galaxy evolution in the equilibrium growth picture: ▪  Scaling relations between galaxy properties are fairly well established among massive galaxies at least out to [Formula: see text], pointing to regulating mechanisms already acting on galaxy growth. ▪  Resolved views reveal that gravitational instabilities and efficient secular processes within the gas- and baryon-rich galaxies at [Formula: see text] play an important role in the early buildup of galactic structure. ▪  Ever more sensitive observations of kinematics at [Formula: see text] are probing the baryon and dark matter budget on galactic scales and the links between star-forming galaxies and their likely descendants. ▪  Toward higher masses, massive bulges, dense cores, and powerful {AGNs} and {AGN}-driven outflows are more prevalent and likely play a role in quenching star formation.

	abstract = {We review the use of emission-lines for understanding galaxy evolution, focusing on excitation source, metallicity, ionization parameter, {ISM} pressure and electron density. We show that the {UV}, optical and infrared contain complementary diagnostics that can probe the conditions within different nebular ionization zones. In anticipation of upcoming telescope facilities, we provide new self-consistent emission-line diagnostic calibrations for complete spectral coverage from the {UV} to the infrared. These diagnostics can be used in concert to understand how fundamental galaxy properties have changed across cosmic time. We describe new 2D and 3D emission-line diagnostics to separate the contributions from star formation, {AGN} and shocks using integral field spectroscopy. We discuss the physics, benefits, and caveats of emission-line diagnostics, including the effect of theoretical model uncertainties, diffuse ionized gas, and sample selection bias. Accounting for complex density gradients and temperature profiles is critical for reliably estimating the fundamental properties of H ii regions and galaxies. Diffuse ionized gas can raise metallicity estimates, flatten metallicity gradients, and introduce scatter in ionization parameter measurements. We summarize with a discussion of the challenges and major opportunities for emission-line diagnostics in the coming years.},

	abstract = {In this review, we explore the historical development and future prospects of artificial intelligence ({AI}) and deep learning in astronomy. We trace the evolution of connectionism in astronomy through its three waves, from the early use of multilayer perceptrons, to the rise of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, and finally to the current era of unsupervised and generative deep learning methods. With the exponential growth of astronomical data, deep learning techniques offer an unprecedented opportunity to uncover valuable insights and tackle previously intractable problems. As we enter the anticipated fourth wave of astronomical connectionism, we argue for the adoption of {GPT}-like foundation models fine-tuned for astronomical applications. Such models could harness the wealth of high-quality, multimodal astronomical data to serve state-of-the-art downstream tasks. To keep pace with advancements driven by Big Tech, we propose a collaborative, open-source approach within the astronomy community to develop and maintain these foundation models, fostering a symbiotic relationship between {AI} and astronomy that capitalizes on the unique strengths of both fields.},
