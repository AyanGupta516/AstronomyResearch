	abstract = {This paper presents new Chandra and {BeppoSAX} observations aimed at investigating the optical/X-ray mismatch in the enigmatic class of the Composite galaxies, discovered by a cross-correlation of {IRAS} and {ROSAT} all sky survey catalogues. These galaxies have been classified as star-forming objects on the basis of their optical spectra, while the detection of weak broad wings in the H(alpha) emission in a few of them and their high X-ray luminosity in the {ROSAT} band indicated the presence of an active nucleus. The analysis of Chandra observations for 4 Composites has revealed nuclear point-like sources, with a typical {AGN} spectrum (Gamma = 1.7-1.9) and little intrinsic absorption. A strong flux variability has been observed on different time scales, in particular most of the sources were brighter at the {ROSAT} epoch. Although of relative low luminosity for the {AGN} class (L(2-10 {keV}) = 3-60 x 10{\textasciicircum}\{41\} erg/s), the active nucleus is nevertheless dominant in the X-ray domain. At other wavelengths it appears to be overwhelmed by the starburst and/or host galaxy light, yielding the Composite classification for these objects.},
